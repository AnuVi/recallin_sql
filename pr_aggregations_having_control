Aggregations are MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(). These ignore null values.

```sql
SELECT 
	job_title,
	count (distinct (job_title)) as position,
  job_location AS location, 
  avg(salary_year_avg) AS salary   
 FROM 
 	job_postings_fact
 WHERE 
 	job_location LIKE '%Estonia%'AND
    job_title LIKE '%data%analyst%';
```
    
    
    
```sql
SELECT 
	job_title,
    count (distinct (job_title)) as position,
    job_location AS location, 
    min(salary_year_avg) AS min_salary,
    max(salary_year_avg) AS max_salary 
 FROM 
 	job_postings_fact
 WHERE 
 	job_location LIKE '%Estonia%'AND
    job_title LIKE '%data%analyst%';
```
    
-- HAVING goes between GROUP BY and ORDER BY


```sql

SELECT 
	job_title,
    job_location AS location,
    salary_year_avg AS salary
 FROM 
 	job_postings_fact
 WHERE 
 	job_location LIKE '%Estonia%'
 group by job_title
 HAVING job_title LIKE 'Bi%'
 ORDER BY salary
```
